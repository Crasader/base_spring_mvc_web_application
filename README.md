Base Spring MVC Web Application
===============================

This project is a base Spring MVC web application that can be used as a starting point to build any Spring MVC application.  It was created to help the initial phase of starting a new project and wiring together the basic elements.  In particular it contains the best practices in a number of areas as follows:

- JavaConfig configuration (where possible - i.e. everything except Spring Security)
- Spring Security
- In-process automated acceptance tests (using new features in Spring 3.2 combined with JSoup)
- Hierachical freemarker (to split up / modularise views)
- Logback (not fully working)
- Resource bundling (not yet implemented)

The intention is that this application is: 
- a simple example 
- a simple test best
- a quick to start any Spring MVC web application
- an easy way to follow best practice

To achieve these aims this project will be kept up to date with the latest features on a regular basis.
